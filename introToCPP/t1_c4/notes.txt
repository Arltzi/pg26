&<var> = memory address
*<pointer> = value
<type>& -> alias
<type>* -> pointer

- stack instantiations are destroyed at the end of scope

- Constructor() = delete;
	- strongly advised, dont let anyone instantiate a class without giving it values

	- paramaterize constructor by adding in the header file

- ostream operator<< is private, make override friend to access

- if the default constructor isnt deleted, its automatically created anyway
