set auto build pipeline to run so that people dont stay late
automation should genuinely help the team, also help their health
complexity in languages is inversely proportional to program size

programming methodology
- identify problem
- propose solution
- evaluate/test
- iterate
- build
- test

SSS (Scott Style Sheet)

- no space between function name and parenthesis
- 

environment variables:
	starting shell creates variables, tell applications in shell where to find things
	PATH: search path to find commands
permission go: user-group-other
directories need execute permission to open
sum.o is object file: compiled version of program, without symbols resolved

file.c -> c compilter -> file.o -> assembler -> (assembly code -> linker && libraries -> linker) -> file.exe

os can chain collection of commands together
< -> standard input
> -> standard output
| -> redirects output from command line to input of another

char* pointer to
char& address
*char contents of char
char** points to list of characters that is string

use gcc to compile c code
% gcc -o sum2 sum.c

any dos/cmd command can be entered into the text file
any executable can be run

assignment:
download two moodle files
copy demo app & olaf to /builds in h: drive
write script that find number of vertices in olaf &
outputs a text log file of the results in builds (hint: redirect standard output)
