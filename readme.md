 - Github branch link: https://github.com/Arltzi/pg26/tree/html
 - I can't put a google drive link because I need to compress and upload it first haha

####**How to use**
--------

TL:DR; click a link on the side to show the contents of the web page, the default page is blank, im very sad about it

Being a smartass came and bit me in the ... . I thought I was a genius by devising this brilliant plan
to completely hide and show different divs to simulate multiple pages, but at the end of everything I
realized the default page had nothing on it. I tried very hard to find a solution, and learned quite
a bit along the way (primarily, browsers put restrictions on the functionality of the a:visited
pseudo-class selector to protect people from stuff like invisible links and websites accessing the
users link click history) because I tried to make a link on the main page that would go invisible after
you click it, but it seemed like the code didnt work when it otherwise should, and lo-and-behold it's a
feature. Otherwise, enjoy!!!
